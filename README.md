# Find it


## Overview
Find it is a client-side JavaScript web application that helps BCIT staff and students find and post lost items. The app displays a curated list of lost items, each with details such as name, location, discription, and an image. Users can browse the list of items and filter them through hashtags.

Developed for the COMP 1800 course, this project applies User-Centred Design practices and agile project management, and demonstrates integration with Firebase backend services for storing user favorites.
